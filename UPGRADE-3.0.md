Upgrading to 3.0
================

  - Remove `navbar` key from configuration, use `menu`
  - Use new assetic config imports for using Resources/views/base.html.twig
    - base_less and base_sass have been removed.
  - Removed initializr, this is too hard to maintain (Need to update jquery and other cdns constantly)
